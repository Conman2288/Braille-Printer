# Braille-Printer
Our project is a personal braille printer with the aim of being one of the cheaper options on the market. The reason that we chose this as our project is because current braille printers cost, on average, over $1,000. By making a more affordable version, we can make braille more accessible for the blind, which is a step towards giving this community a better quality of life. The way that our project works is by using an embosser that moves along a lead screw. This embosser has a set of multiple braille states that are essentially specific bumps that can be switched to on command. A flexible roller is then rolled over the desired state, with the paper in between, in order to emboss the braille onto the paper. The program running on the machine is able to take in a text or pdf file and scan the words in the file. It takes these words and converts them into braille characters, which are then split into their multiple braille states, as each character is made up of two different states. These braille states are then sent to the printer, where, line by line, the braille characters are embossed into the piece of paper. This all comes together to make a device that can receive text input and subsequently print out braille characters, making braille printing accessible at a lower cost than is currently on the market.
